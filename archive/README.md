# testqr

test repo for embedding logo into QR image and color, format customization

## TODO

NOTE: this is a sub repo in a larger project. Lets see if we can get one method transitioned to the new way of doing things. 

- remove dependency on templates
- migrate method in template_test.py to svgwrite as it is used in sample_code.py 
- remove dependency on rsvg-convert, try to find some other way to write SVG to PNG without writing to disk. 

## how to run

rsvg-convert  -  to be deprecated, install unbuntu: 

```
sudo apt install librsvg2-bin
sudo apt-get rsvg-convert
```

Requires at least python3.8

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 template_test.py 
```

- change colors in template_test.py

- EDIT SVG TEMPLATE FILE to refer to qr_code, idnumber, expires and sats
with {{ }}, For example: 

```<image
         width="166.29921"
         height="166.51379"
         preserveAspectRatio="none"
         href={{qrcode}}
         id="image4277"
         x="811.72894"
         y="208.38103" />
```

## Result

Final image after QR code and background SVG image are merged together in a PNG should look like image below. 
IMPORTANT: The final image MUST be in PNG format, it cannot be in SVG.
